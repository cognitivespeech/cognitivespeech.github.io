  <meta name="description" content="While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Cipher, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) framework that unifies AR and flow-matching, which processes audio codec tokens in chunks with a 48kHz codec at a compact 12.5 token-per-second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Consequently, Cipher can utilize KV-cache across chunks and incorporate future context within each. Furthermore, Cipher bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens through finite-state quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make Cipher particularly effective for generating extended content. Experiments on podcast datasets demonstrate Cipher's capability to efficiently generate high-quality podcasts.">
